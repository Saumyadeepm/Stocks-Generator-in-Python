# Stocks-Generator-in-Python
# Creating an Program to Generate Stocks using OOPS in Python
 • Creating a Class for storing Stock Price. A stock price will have the time of observation, open value, high value, low value, and current value (we are not considering the close value for this problem).
 
 • The observation time will be generated based on the actual time that the object is created (system's time).
 
 • Other values could be created through Constructors, after giving a prompt to Users.
 
 • Creating Getter and Setter methods for any of the parameters.
